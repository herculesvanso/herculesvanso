# Hi!!


## Hércules here, thanks for your curiosity. Let's introduce myself.

I obtained a bachelor's degree in Math by UFG - Univserdade Federal de Goiás in 2023.
In my bachelor's degree I had contact with programming in C, contact database modeling and basic queries in Postgres, robust contact with statistics and a  in convex optimization (about 3 years in scintific projects in that area).
Now that I had finish my bachelor's I decide to explory the data scince universe.
For that I stud in my vague time topics in data science.

> About Python
At momento, I dont remenbor who I started, but I have a good knooledge of Python in libraries, including Pandas and Numpy. I did not any course, was just google searching.

> About English
* I read very well, in particular some niches like math and computional science (articles, documentations, magazines)
* I dont practice speach with peoples, just alone. However I can well apresent and listen some themes in math and computional science.

> About database modeling
