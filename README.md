# Hi!

I obtained a bachelor's degree in Math by UFG - Univserdade Federal de Goi√°s in 2023.
In my bachelor's degree I had contact with programming in C, contact database modeling and basic queries in Postgres, robust contact with statistics and convex optimization (about 3 years in scintific projects in that area).
Now that I had finish my bachelor's I decide to explory the data scince universe.
For that I stud in my vague time topics in data science.

### About Python
At the momente I dont remenber who I started, but I have a good knoowledge of Python, including Pandas and Numpy libraries.

### About english
* I classified my english as intermediary.
* I read well, especially very well in some niches such as mathematics and computer science (articles, documentation, magazines)
*I don't practice talking to people, only alone. However, I can present and listen to some mathematics and computer science topics.

### About database modeling
